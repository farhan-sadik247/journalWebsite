/**
 * NOTIFICATION SYSTEM IMPLEMENTATION SUMMARY
 * ==========================================
 * 
 * OBJECTIVE: When a reviewer gives an "Accept" recommendation, the author should receive 
 * notifications for both acceptance and payment.
 * 
 * IMPLEMENTATION:
 * ---------------
 * 
 * 1. DUAL NOTIFICATION SYSTEM
 *    - Enhanced `notifyManuscriptAcceptedWithFee` in `/src/lib/notificationUtils.ts`
 *    - Now creates TWO separate notifications instead of one combined notification:
 *      a) Acceptance notification (type: 'manuscript_status')
 *      b) Payment notification (type: 'payment_required') OR waiver notification
 * 
 * 2. WORKFLOW INTEGRATION
 *    - Review submission API (`/src/app/api/reviews/[id]/route.ts`) triggers notifications
 *    - When a review is marked as "accept", it calls `handleAcceptedManuscript`
 *    - `handleAcceptedManuscript` calls `notifyManuscriptAcceptedWithFee`
 *    - Supports both single and multiple review workflows
 * 
 * 3. NOTIFICATION TYPES
 *    - **Acceptance Notification**
 *      - Type: 'manuscript_status'
 *      - Title: "Manuscript Accepted for Publication"
 *      - Icon: ðŸ“„ (in notifications UI)
 *      - Priority: High
 *      - Action: Links to manuscript detail page
 * 
 *    - **Payment Notification**
 *      - Type: 'payment_required'
 *      - Title: "Article Processing Charge (APC) Payment Required"
 *      - Icon: ðŸ’³ (in notifications UI)
 *      - Priority: High
 *      - Action: Links to payment page with pre-filled amount
 * 
 *    - **Fee Waiver Notification** (if applicable)
 *      - Type: 'manuscript_status'
 *      - Title: "Publication Fee Waived - Proceeding to Production"
 *      - Icon: ðŸ“„ (in notifications UI)
 *      - Priority: Medium
 *      - Action: Links to manuscript detail page
 * 
 * 4. TESTING
 *    - Created test API endpoint: `/api/test-notifications`
 *    - Created test page: `/test-notifications`
 *    - Verified notification creation and delivery
 * 
 * WORKFLOW EXAMPLE:
 * ----------------
 * 1. Reviewer submits review with "accept" recommendation
 * 2. System updates manuscript status to "accepted"
 * 3. System creates acceptance notification for author
 * 4. System calculates publication fee based on author's country/institution
 * 5. System creates payment notification (or waiver notification if applicable)
 * 6. Author receives both notifications in their dashboard
 * 7. Author can click notifications to navigate to relevant pages
 * 
 * FILES MODIFIED:
 * --------------
 * - src/lib/notificationUtils.ts (Enhanced dual notification system)
 * - src/app/api/reviews/[id]/route.ts (Updated logging for notification result)
 * - src/app/api/test-notifications/route.ts (New test endpoint)
 * - src/app/test-notifications/page.tsx (New test page)
 * 
 * VERIFICATION:
 * ------------
 * âœ… Dual notification system implemented
 * âœ… Workflow integration working
 * âœ… Notifications UI supports both types
 * âœ… Test infrastructure created
 * âœ… Real-time status updates working
 * âœ… Single review acceptance triggers notifications
 * âœ… Multiple review workflows still supported
 * 
 * EDGE CASES HANDLED:
 * ------------------
 * - Fee waivers for certain countries/institutions
 * - Single vs. multiple review scenarios
 * - Notification creation failures (non-blocking)
 * - Author identification from manuscript data
 * - Role-based access to notification APIs
