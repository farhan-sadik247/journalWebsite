## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Secure Payment Processing
- **Stripe Elements Integration**: Secure card input with real-time validation
- **PCI Compliance**: All sensitive data handled by Stripe
- **Payment Intents**: Supports Strong Customer Authentication (SCA)
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error messages and validation

### 2. Payment Workflow
```
Manuscript Accepted → Create Payment Record → Redirect to Payment Portal → 
Process Payment → Webhook Updates Status → Email Confirmation → 
Continue to Production
```

### 3. Payment Portal Features
- **Responsive Design**: Works on all devices
- **Payment Summary**: Clear fee breakdown and invoice details
- **Billing Information**: Auto-populated from manuscript data
- **Security Indicators**: SSL and Stripe security badges
- **Real-time Processing**: Immediate feedback and status updates

### 4. Webhook Integration
- **Automatic Status Updates**: Payment status updated via webhooks
- **Notification System**: Email confirmations on payment success
- **Manuscript Workflow**: Automatic progression to production status
- **Error Recovery**: Handles failed payments and cancellations

### 5. Admin Features
- **Payment Dashboard**: View all payments with filtering
- **Manual Controls**: Mark payments as completed/failed if needed
- **Payment Details**: Comprehensive payment information and history

## Payment Flow

### User Experience
1. Manuscript is accepted for publication
2. User clicks "Proceed to Payment" button
3. System creates payment record with billing information
4. User is redirected to secure payment portal
5. User enters card details using Stripe Elements
6. Payment is processed securely by Stripe
7. System receives webhook confirmation
8. User receives email confirmation
9. Manuscript status automatically updates to "in-production"

### Technical Flow
1. **Payment Creation**: `POST /api/payments` creates payment record
2. **Intent Creation**: `POST /api/payments/create-intent` creates Stripe PaymentIntent
3. **Card Processing**: Frontend uses Stripe.js to securely process payment
4. **Webhook Processing**: `POST /api/payments/webhook` handles Stripe events
5. **Status Updates**: Database and user notifications updated automatically

## Security Considerations

### Payment Security
- ✅ No card data stored on application servers
- ✅ All payment data encrypted in transit
- ✅ PCI DSS compliance handled by Stripe
- ✅ Strong Customer Authentication (SCA) support

### API Security
- ✅ Authentication required for all payment endpoints
- ✅ User authorization checks (authors can only access their payments)
- ✅ Admin-only operations protected
- ✅ Webhook signature verification

## Configuration Required

### Environment Variables
```bash
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_...
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...
```

### Stripe Dashboard Setup
1. Create Stripe account
2. Get API keys from Dashboard
3. Configure webhook endpoint (optional but recommended)
4. Set up payment settings and branding

## Testing

### Test Cards
- **Success**: 4242 4242 4242 4242
- **Decline**: 4000 0000 0000 0002
- **3D Secure**: 4000 0025 0000 3155

### Test Workflow
1. Set manuscript status to "accepted"
2. Navigate to manuscript detail page
