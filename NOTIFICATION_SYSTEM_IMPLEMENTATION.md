4. **Copy-Editor Assignment**: Admin assigns copy-editor, both author and copy-editor are notified
5. **Copy-Editing**: Copy-editor completes work and marks draft as ready, author is notified
6. **Author Review**: Author reviews and approves draft, editor is notified
7. **Publication**: Editor publishes manuscript, author receives publication success notification
