# Post-Acceptance Workflow Fixes - Implementation Summary

- Enhanced the copy-editor filter to include all relevant statuses: `['accepted', 'accepted-awaiting-copy-edit', 'in-copy-editing', 'copy-editing-complete', 'in-production']`
- Copy-editors now see all manuscripts in the copy-editing pipeline, not just accepted ones

### 3. **Copy-Editing Stage Status Transitions**
**File**: `src/app/api/manuscripts/[id]/copy-editing/route.ts`
- Added automatic status updates based on copy-editing stage:
  - `copy-editing` ‚Üí `accepted-awaiting-copy-edit`
  - `author-review`, `proofreading`, `typesetting` ‚Üí `in-copy-editing`
  - `final-review` ‚Üí `copy-editing-complete`
  - `ready-for-publication` ‚Üí `in-production`
