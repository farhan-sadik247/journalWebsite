# Payment System Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Multiple Payments Not Visible to Editors
**Problem**: Editors could only see the latest payment submission, not all payments for a manuscript.

**Solution**: 
- Added `allPayments` state to store all payment submissions
- Modified `fetchPaymentInfo` to store all payments and show appropriate payment based on user role
- Added a new section that displays all payments for admins/editors
- For editors/admins: Shows latest pending payment (if exists) or latest payment
- For authors: Shows latest payment

### 2. Resubmit Payment Modal Not Working
**Problem**: Authors couldn't resubmit payment information when payment was rejected.

**Solution**:
- Increased modal z-index from 1000 to 9999 to ensure it appears above other elements
- Removed debug console.log calls that were interfering with rendering
- Cleaned up modal structure and removed unnecessary debug elements
- Fixed modal rendering logic to properly show/hide based on state

## New Features Added

### 1. Payment History for Admins/Editors
- New section showing all payment submissions with:
  - Payment number (chronological order)
  - Amount and status
  - Submission date
  - View/Current buttons to switch between payments
- Color-coded status indicators:
  - Yellow for pending
  - Green for completed
  - Red for rejected

### 2. Enhanced Payment Display Logic
- Admins/editors see pending payments prioritized
- Authors see their latest payment submission
- Proper handling of multiple payment scenarios

## Technical Changes

### Files Modified:
1. `PaymentInfoDisplay.tsx`
   - Added `allPayments` state
   - Enhanced `fetchPaymentInfo` function
   - Added payment history section for admins/editors
   - Cleaned up modal rendering

2. `PaymentInfoModal.tsx`
   - Removed debug elements
   - Fixed modal structure

3. `PaymentInfoDisplay.module.scss`
   - Added styles for payment history section
   - Payment status color coding
   - Responsive payment list design

4. `PaymentInfoModal.module.scss`
   - Increased z-index for better visibility

## Testing

To test the fixes:

1. **As an Editor/Admin:**
   - Navigate to a manuscript with multiple payments
   - Should see "All Payment Submissions" section
   - Can click "View" to switch between different payments
   - Can approve/reject pending payments

2. **As an Author:**
   - If payment is rejected, click "Re-submit Payment Information"
   - Modal should appear properly
   - Should be able to submit new payment info
   - Modal should close after successful submission

## API Behavior

The payment API already returns all payments sorted by creation date (newest first). The frontend now properly utilizes this data to show:
- All payments to admins/editors
- Appropriate payment selection based on user role
- Proper modal functionality for resubmissions
